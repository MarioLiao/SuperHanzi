### Description

The proposal of our web application is to create a Chinese writing app, where new Chinese learners can learn how to write the Chinese characters. When the user is practcing or learning a Chinese character, our app will give the user feedback, to whether or not they have done the correct stroke order, the generally correct stroke, and the position of the start of the stroke. Along with users being able to “learn” and “review” Chinese characters, we will have an additional feature where users can play a game. This game will be a 1 vs 1 game, where the app will score the users based on their speed of, the amount of mistakes they made, and how many strokes they can finish within the allotted time.
